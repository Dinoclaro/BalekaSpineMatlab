This Simscape model was created as a proof of concept to show that the motors are powerful enough for the desired behaviour. Meaning that it has not been properly verified, and makes use of various simplifications, in particular, motor models are carbon copies of Baleka and friction is ignored. Additionally, it is likely that there are errors in implementation and such as incorrect inertias, incorrect frame locations etc. 

If this is to be used for a proper analysis it should be vetted first.
